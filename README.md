[General Stats Panel]

In our first panel, we start with a map of NYC and created a bubble map to visually show the popular starting locations. The size and color reflect the number of rides in those areas. Next, we have a line graph with the peak riding hours for our bikes and a pie chart of all the rides broken down by gender.

Our second panel shows two heat maps for a deeper dive into peak hours usage. The top heatmap is broken down by days of the week and time of day the bikes are used. The bottom heatmap goes a step further and splits the heatmap by gender.

Our third panel uses two line graphics to visualize trip durations. The top line graph is all rides vs time and the bottom line graph has the rides broken down by gender vs time.

Our last panel continues looking at trip durations but with the rides broken down by subscribers and nonsubscribers. Our heatmap here explores our subscribers/nonsubscribers broken down by gender and usage during the week.

## Summary

Looking at the data we can say the common usage rates are during the weekdays are during commute hours of 6am to 9am and 4pm to 7pm. The weekends also see a good amount of usage but more evenly spread out between 8am to 8pm. The most common usage duration is between 3 to 10 minutes with majority of our users male and subscribers. To expand this analysis, we may want to create a pie chart of our subscribers and customs based on gender and also a bar chart looking at the age of our users.
